<p><font face="Arial">
Generally, there are three ways to avoid or reduce metallic distortion.&nbsp;<br>

By choosing a DC magnetic tracker from Ascension, you have made the best decision for obtaining great tracking performance in real-world environments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Ascension transmitters emit a series of steady DC fields that do not continuously generate eddy currents in nearby metals. This enables them to operate accurately in workspaces full of common conductive metals, such as aluminum, non-magnetic stainless steel, zinc, nickel, bronze, tin and brass.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
AC trackers, on the other hand, continuously generate eddy currents in nearby conductive metals. Eddy currents are the phenomenon that badly distorts measurements in trackers that emit AC electromagnetic fields, such as Polhemus'
FASTRAK, IsoTrak and Liberty trackers.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Generally, DC trackers are 5 times less susceptible to conductive-metal distortion than AC trackers. This means that the accuracy of an AC tracker in real world applications in which conductive metals are present
may be 5 times worse than specified in Polhemus sales literature.  In one recent test, a 12-inch plate  of non-magnetic stainless steel was introduced to the workspaces of an AC and a DC tracker. The metal produced errors of 100 degrees and 5 inches in the AC tracker. No discernable errors were detected in the DC tracker.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
DC trackers typically perform as specified in all kinds of environments. DC trackers are also less susceptible to errors  caused by the presence of ferrous metals, such as iron and carbon steel.&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<i><b><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="5"><a name="two"></a>Change
Tracker Measurement Rate</font></b></i><br>
<font face="Arial">
<br>
DC trackers nominally track sensor motion at 86 -105 measurements per second. At this rate, the tracker will not see low conductive, low permeability metals such as non-magnetic stainless steel (300 series and the other common metals cited above). In the  presence of highly conductive metals, such as aluminum, you can reduce metal errors to zero simply by decreasing the DC tracker measurement rate. Experimenting with measurement rates will let you choose the right rate for your application while minimizing the effect of filtering on lag.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note that changing the measurement rate of a DC tracker will not have a positive effect when in the presence of low conductive, high permeable metals such as carbon steel. In this workspace, the best approach is to move away from its distorting effects.</font><br>

<br>
<font face="Arial">
Ascension's <b>Quality Indicator</b> is an especially valuable tool to alert you to the presence of distorting metal.  You can use it to
detect metallic hot spots in your workspace so you can adjust parameters or re-locate transmitter/sensors.
See an implmentation of the Quality indicator in the <i>Cubes </i>demo
utility.&nbsp;
